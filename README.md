# data-512-homework_2-
This repository contains all of the necessary files and code that were used and generated by HW2: Homework 2 - Considering Bias in Data in the DATA 512 Course as a part of the UW MSDS Program. 

## Goal
The primary objective of this project is to analyze Wikipedia article coverage and quality across various countries and regions. By merging multiple datasets, including population statistics and article quality predictions, we aim to calculate key metrics such as total articles per capita and high-quality articles per capita. This analysis provides insights into the accessibility and representation of information across different geographic areas, highlighting potential biases and gaps in Wikipedia's content.

##  Data Source

The created data is acquired from two sources. First, from the Wikimedia Analytics API's Pageviews API, which provides access to traffic data for articles across the English Wikipedia. For more information on the API, please see the Wikimedia Pageviews API documentation.

Second, the predicted quality scores for each article in the Wikipedia dataset were obtained by using machine learning system called ORES (Objective Revision Evaluation Service) ORES is a machine learning tool that can provide estimates of Wikipedia article quality. The article quality estimates are, from best to worst:
- FA : Featured article
- GA : Good article (also known as A-Class)
- B : B-Class article
- C : C-Class article
- Start : Start-class article
- Stub : Stub-class article

You can use the API:Info request to get a range of metadata on an article, including the most current revision ID of the article page.

There are also two raw data files that were used in this analysis: 

- `politicians_by_country_AUG.2024.csv`: The data in this file was obtained by web crawling the Wikipedia pages to generate a list of Wikipedia article pages about politicians from a wide range of countries. 

- `population_by_country_AUG.2024.csv`:This dataset was downloaded from the world population data sheet published by the Population Reference Bureau.

## Field Descriptions
The final data file `wp_politicians_by_country.csv` contains the following fields:

| Column Name     | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| country         | string | The name of the country or region that the article's POI (person of interest) is from.                                                          |
| region          | string | The geographic region assigned to the country, reflecting its hierarchical position in a regional structure.                                    |
| population      | float  | The population of the country, represented in millions.                                                                                         |
| article_title   | string | The title of the Wikipedia article associated with the country or region.                                                                       |
| revision_id     | float  | The unique identifier for the specific revision of the Wikipedia article.                                                                       |
| article_quality | string | The predicted quality of the Wikipedia article, classified as "FA" (Featured Article), "GA" (Good Article), or other categories (e.g., "Stub"). |

## Known Issues and Special Considerations
- Data Gaps: There may be countries or regions that lack corresponding entries in the population dataset or Wikipedia articles. This can lead to misleading metrics if not carefully accounted for during analysis. Specifically, there are no articles present in the data set that are found in North America. To find a list of of countries that there is no data for, please refer to this file: `wp_countries-no_match.txt`. 
- Bias in Article Representation: The data may reflect systemic biases in Wikipedia's content creation, which is often influenced by editor demographics and availability of resources, leading to disparities in article coverage and quality.
- Hierarchical Regions: The assignment of countries to regions is based on a hierarchical structure. Some countries may fit into multiple regions; however, for this analysis, they were placed in the closest (lowest in the hierarchy) region.
- Inf Values: Some countries and regions showed infinite values for articles per capita, which indicates either very low population counts or a high number of articles relative to population size. Further investigation is needed to interpret these cases appropriately.

## Research Implications

Throughout the analysis, I learned that the distribution of Wikipedia articles is not a reflection of population size or political importance but also has deeper societal biases. For example, I was surprised to find that countries with significantly smaller populations, such as Tuvalu and Monaco, had disproportionately high numbers of articles, which resulted in infinite ratios for articles per capita. This discrepancy suggests that these countries may have a dedicated base of contributors who prioritize documenting their own history and culture. On the other hand, I also noticed that populous countries like China and India ranked among the bottom for total articles per capita, which made me think of questions about the factors that might contribute to this disparity. 

These findings show that biases may stem from varying levels of internet accessibility, the presence of active Wikipedia editors, and cultural priorities around information sharing. Overall, this analysis reinforced the idea that while Wikipedia aims to be a global knowledge repository, the actual representation of countries is uneven and influenced by complex socio-political dynamics.

#### What biases did you expect to find in the data (before you started working with it), and why?
Before starting the analysis, I expected finding biases related to the representation of countries on Wikipedia. I thought that countries with larger populations or more prominent global influence, such as the United States and China, would have significantly more articles compared to smaller nations. I also suspected that certain regions, particularly those with limited internet access or lower levels of digital literacy, might be underrepresented in terms of article coverage and quality. This expectation stemmed from the understanding that Wikipedia is a user-generated platform, where content creation is often influenced by contributors' geographic, cultural, and economic backgrounds.

#### What might your results suggest about the internet and global society in general?
The results of the analysis reveal important insights about how knowledge is distributed across the globe. The stark contrast in article coverage and quality between various countries indicates that the internet, while a powerful tool for democratizing information, also reflects existing inequalities. Countries with robust internet infrastructure and active online communities tend to have a more substantial presence on platforms like Wikipedia, while those facing challenges such as limited access or lower engagement levels are left behind. This disparity highlights the need for targeted efforts to promote equitable knowledge sharing and representation in the digital sphere, suggesting that the internet is both a means of empowerment and a potential source of exclusion.

#### How might a researcher supplement or transform this dataset to potentially correct for the limitations/biases you observed?
To address the limitations and biases observed in the dataset, researchers could supplement the existing data with additional sources, such as demographic and socio-economic information from international databases like the World Bank or UN datasets. This could help contextualize the findings and provide a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing article creation and quality. Furthermore, researchers could incorporate qualitative data, such as surveys or interviews with Wikipedia editors from diverse backgrounds, to gain insights into their motivations and experiences. This multifaceted approach would enhance the richness of the analysis and provide a more comprehensive view of the dynamics at play within Wikipedia and its representation of global knowledge.
